<h3># Subread, avialable at https://subread.sourceforge.net/ , is a powerful suite of analysis functions. Once installed, you establish an environment in miniconda, and run Subread functions in that environment.
<h3># For instance, after entering my "Lab" environment, I am attempting to quantitate the number of each transcript from a pair-ended sequencing transcriptome for six sample cells, three controls, a.bam, b.bam, and c.bam, as well as three knockdowns, 1.bam, 2.bam, and 3.bam:</h3>

```
$ featureCounts -a referenceGenome.gtf -t exon -g gene_id -p -o counts.txt a.bam b.bam c.bam 1.bam 2.bam 3.bam
```

<h3>featureCounts will output a dataframe of the uith a number of columns equal to the number of samples analyzed, one row for each detected transcript, and the value of each cell equal to the number of times the transcript was detected in the experiment.
